[Trusona raises $20 million to bring passwordless authentication to more businesses](https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/14/trusona-raises-20-million-to-bring-passwordless-authentication-to-more-businesses/)

## Brief Summary and Thoughts:
 Trusona has developed a no-password login system using QR codes. Users scan a randomly generated QR code on 
 their computer using the Trusona mobile app to login automatically. It is basically MFA without having to also provide a password.
 Trusona also has an option for users to scan their driver's liscense for authentication. I like the idea of moving away from passwords and creating a faster
 MFA system. The NYU MFA system is inconvenient and annoying in my opinion. Having a password as well as traditional MFA methods can be tedious for every website. Also, most people use similar passwords for multiple accounts. However, MFA solutions have been hacked already so eliminating passwords may backfire in the future. If Trusona's system is proven to be safe throughout the next year, I can see it replacing most login authenticators. What I find interesting is the necessity of smartphones now. Another new passwordless company, HYPR, offers the same service as Trusona and for those without smartphones, it allows for a computer Touch ID or Windows Hello authentication system. Regardless, passwords may become obsolute for most websites in the near future. Hopefully, NYU makes the switch to Trusona or HYPR. 

 ## Comment by Ari Khaytser:
I think this technology will start spreading a lot faster in the near future, and it seems like it will be pretty convenient if implemented well (and securely). Without having to remember a password, it will be interesting to see what it will be like without the "human element" as part of the authentication system. Interesting article!

## Comment by Allyson Chan:
Moving away from passwords does seem like a really good idea, because of how much effort it takes to track multiple secure passwords for many different applicaitons, most people just don't do it and end up using the same passwords for everything. I kind of wonder though, what kind of security risks might happen with this new method of logging in. Since it's so new, there might be problems in the future and if passwords are completely eliminated, what is the backup plan in case something goes wrong?
