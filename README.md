## Brief Summary and Thoughts:
    Trusona has developed a no-password login system using QR codes. Users scan a randomly generated QR code on 
    their computer using the Trusona mobile app to login automatically. It is basically MFA without having to also provide a password.
    Salesforce has already implemented Trusona's new software in their login page. I like the idea of moving away from passwords overall. 
    Having a password as well as traditional MFA methods can be tedious for every website. Also, most people use similar passwords for multiple accounts. 
    However, MFA solutions have been hacked already so eliminating passwords may backfire in the future.
