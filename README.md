## Brief Summary and Thoughts:
    Trusona has developed a no-password login system using QR codes. Users scan a randomly generated QR code on 
    their computer using the Trusona mobile app to login automatically. It is basically MFA without having to also provide a password.
    Trusona also has an option for users to scan their driver's liscense for authentication. I like the idea of moving away from passwords. 
    Having a password as well as traditional MFA methods can be tedious for every website. Also, most people use similar passwords for multiple accounts. 
    However, MFA solutions have been hacked already so eliminating passwords may backfire in the future. If Trusona's system is proven to be safe and 
    faster than other MFA solutions, I can see it replacing most login authenticators in the near future.
